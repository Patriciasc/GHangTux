What Is 'GHangtux?'

       GHangtux is a free program variation of the popular Hangman game.
       It has been designed for people of all ages and has a simple, 
       easy-to-use interface.

       It provides a keyboard and a sentence/word to guess, whose theme 
       the player is able to select. Current themes are: films, objects 
       and persons.

       A graphic sequence of tux images will be displayed during the game,
       indicating the player how many attempts he/she has left.

How To Play 'GHangtux?'

       GHangman is a game for one player. A sentence/word will be displayed 
       and the player can try to guess it by suggesting letters.

       The sentence/word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving 
       the number of letters. If the player suggests a letter which occurs 
       in the word, it will be displayed in all its correct positions. 
       If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, a new image of
       Tux will be shown. The game is over when:

          * The player completes the sentence/word.
          * All Tux images has been shown.
